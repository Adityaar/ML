# ML
Machine learning lab

I wrote my first ML program back in 2005 during my masters course where i had opportunity to learn foundations in ML by Tom Mitchell and i thoroughly enjoyed the doing that course.
It was a simple program that classifies an email as SPAM/NOT SPAM using Naive Bayes classifier. But, surprisingly works very well with nearly ~95% accuracy. 

After more than a decade, i now see a lot of hype around ML. 
So, i started looking at ML from a fresh perspective to see its current state of things. To see, how has ML changed over the years.

There seems to be a paradigm shift in ML when you compare ML pre-2010 and post-2010 without contradicting the core principles
of Machine learning itself.
Post-2010(last 8 years), we see a lot of neural network based models that were not practically used for the past few decades, but came in use now. 

This repo will include all the code/programs that i wrote during my journey of learning ML.
